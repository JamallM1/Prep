## Conflict Plan

We will resolve conflict by approaching each other honestly and giving everyone a chance to be heard.We will be understanding of everyone’s skill level and can adjust the work load and partner programming appropriately.

If members are not adequately contributing we will approach the member professionally and talk about a solution to the problem. If resolution attempts are unsuccessful we will approach our instructor's to help resolve the problem if no resolution can be made from within the team.
